# Redi School Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks used in the Redi School machine learning course. Each notebook begins with a short "Learning Resources" section linking to external documentation and showing a minimal example of a `train_test_split` call. You will also find blank cells in many notebooks marked with a practice comment so you can try out the concepts yourself. The notebooks cover topics from basic data manipulation to more advanced models.


## Running the notebooks

1. Install Jupyter and the required Python packages (e.g. `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).
2. Start Jupyter with `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`.
3. Open any notebook from the folder of interest.

If you are unsure about a method used in a notebook, follow the links in the first cell of that notebook for further reading.

## Folder overview

- `data manipulation` – introductory material on pandas and workflow basics
- `Cross_Validation` – examples of splitting data beyond a simple train/test split
- `Decision Trees`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient_Descent`, `Regularization` – model specific lessons
- `Feature_Engineering` and `Feature_Expansion` – preparing features for machine learning
- `Hyperparameter_Optimization` – tuning model parameters
- `Group By and Aggregation`, `DateTime in Pandas` – working with complex data structures
- `Linear Regression` and `Logistic Regression` – classical modeling methods
- `Plotting with Python` – creating visualizations

Feel free to experiment with the notebooks and extend them with your own examples.
